# Data Structures in C - Educational Implementations

Welcome to the **Data Structures in C** repository! This project is designed for **educational purposes**, providing clear and structured implementations of various fundamental data structures in C. Whether you're a student, developer, or enthusiast looking to deepen your understanding of data structures, this repository serves as a valuable learning resource.

<br>

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of different data structures in C, with a focus on **dynamic memory allocation, efficient traversal, and structured coding practices**. Each folder corresponds to a specific data structure, containing:
- 📜 **C Source Code**: Well-structured and documented implementation.
- 📘 **README Files**: Detailed explanations on how each data structure works.
- 📝 **Examples & Outputs**: Practical use cases with sample inputs and expected outputs.

## 📂 Available Implementations

### 1️⃣ [3D Matrix / Array](./array) 
- A dynamically allocated **three-dimensional matrix**.
- Demonstrates memory allocation (`malloc`), data traversal, and memory deallocation (`free`).
- Includes a user input mechanism for custom matrix dimensions.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate** to the folder of the desired data structure.
2. **Compile** the C file using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc [filename].c -o [output-name]
   ```
3. **Run** the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./[output-name]
   ```
4. **Follow** the program instructions for input and observe the output.
